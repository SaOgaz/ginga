Roadmap for Ginga
==================

This is a roadmap for Ginga development, which lays out
the long-term plans for this package.

*Note: As a caveat, this is a living document, and
will evolve as priorities grow and shift.*

Last updated: July 2018

Short-Term Goals
----------------

Things that might happen in the next release or two:

* Python 3.7 support.
* Last major release that is compatible with Python 2.
  After this release, ``master`` would be only
  compatible with Python 3.6 and above.

Mid-Term Goals
--------------

Things that might happen in 1-1.5 years:

* Dropping Python 2 support (by the end of 2019).
* Improve vector types support (e.g., ``Lines``, ``Boxes``, ``Points``, etc).
* Support ASDF and GWCS.

Long-Term Goals
---------------

Things that are nice to have but do not have a specific
implementation timeline:

* Complete documentation overhaul with more user-friendly
  examples.
* Out-of-memory big data support.
